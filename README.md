### Overview

Dragon6 Locale is a collection of RESX files that are used in the Dragon6 Mobile app.

The purpose of publishing these is so more developers creating stats apps can reach a larger target audience. It is easy
to set up and has the capacity to support a large variety of languages.

### Who/What can this be used for?

Any Stats app that involves weapons (like CS:GO, PUBG, Valorant and Rainbow Six) can probably make use of these
somehow (note these _are_ primarily for our Dragon6 apps)

### Setup & Usage

To use in your own project, use the nuget build (click the nuget shield) and access the strings via the base
namespace `DragonFruit.Six.Locale` (each file is its own class)

### Contributing and reporting issues

You can help translate these over at the [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/dragon6). We periodically update
this repo with the built translations. Valid issues can be reported through
the [Dragon6 Issue Tracker](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/dragon6/issues).

### Licence
Adding some text like `DragonFruit.Six.Locale Copyright (C) 2020-2021 DragonFruit Network` to your about page is sufficient.
