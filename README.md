### Overview 
Dragon6 Locale is a collection of RESX files that are used in the Dragon6 Mobile app.

The purpose of publishing these is so more developers creating stats apps can reach a larger target audience.
It is easy to set up and has the capacity to support a large variety of languages.

### Who/What can this be used for?
Any Stats app that involves weapons (like CS:GO, PUBG, Valorant and Rainbow Six) can probably make use of these somehow (note these _are_ primarily for our Dragon6 apps)

### Setup & Usage
To use in your own project, use the nuget build (click the nuget shield) and access the strings via the base namespace `DragonFruit.Six.Locale` (each file is its own class)

### Contributing and reporting issues
You can help us out (or create issues) on our [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/dragon6). We periodically update this repo with the built translations.

### Licence
All you need to do is add `DragonFruit.Six.Locale Copyright (C) 2020 DragonFruit Network` to your about page and we will be happy :)
