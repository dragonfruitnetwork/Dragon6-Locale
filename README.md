### Overview 
Dragon6 Locale is a collection of RESX files that are used in the Dragon6 Mobile app.

The Purpose of publishing these is so more developers creating stats apps can reach a larger target audience.
It is easy to set up and will support a large collection of languages.

### What can this be used for?
Any Stats app that involves weapons (like CS:GO, PUBG, Valorant and Rainbow Six)

### Setup & Usage
To use in your own project, use the nuget build (click the nuget shield) and access the string via `DragonFruit.Six.Locale.Core.{stringName}`

### Contribute
You can help us out on our Crowdin Server, and every so often, we will update this repo with the built translations. You can find our project at [DragonFruit Translate](https://translate.dragonfruit.network)

### Licence
All you need to do is add `DragonFruit.Locale Copyright (C) 2020 DragonFruit Network` to your about page and we will be happy :)
